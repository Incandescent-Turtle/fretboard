# Fretboard Visualizer
Unfinished.  
The intent was to be able to select which notes you want to see on the neck, as well as being able to pick scales and chords to highlight all over the neck.

## Capability 
Note that all of these are only done programmatically, and there is no GUI to do these.
<hr width="25%">

All notes can be added on the neck.

Notes can be displayed only on select strings.

## Future Hopes
A menu to select chords and scales to display to the neck. This entails a format to input scales (possibly marked with whole/half steps so only the pattern of a scale is needed, and it can then be applied to all notes).
