unfinished - should place scales on virtual guitar neck

currenty can place notes anywhere on the guitar neck.

hopefully ill some day add a drop down menu to place chords and scales etc on the neck to help identify shapes
idrk how music works but its all patterns and math so its probably possible with automation n stuff idk
